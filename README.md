# üîê Password Security Tool

A Python-based command-line utility for **checking password strength**, **detecting compromised passwords** via HaveIBeenPwned, and **generating strong passwords** or passphrases.

---

## üìú Features
- **Password Strength Analysis**
  - Checks length, character variety, and common patterns.
  - Calculates **entropy** (measure of randomness) in bits.
- **Breach Database Lookup**
  - Uses the [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) API with **k-anonymity** to protect your password.
- **Password Generation**
  - Secure random passwords with letters, digits, and symbols.
  - Easy-to-remember passphrases using a NATO phonetic-style word list.
- **Actionable Feedback**
  - Suggests improvements for weak or moderate passwords.

## üõ† Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-security-tool.git
   cd password-security-tool


2. **Install dependncies**
   ```bash
   pip install requests

3. **Run the Tool**
   ```bash
   python password_tool.py
---
   ## üöÄ Usage
1. **When you run the script, you'll be prompted to enter a password to check:**
   ```bash
   $ python password_tool.py
   === Password Security Tool ===
   Enter password to test: MyP@ssw0rd123!
   Strength: Strong
   Entropy: 78.58 bits
---

2. **Weak or moderate passwords will get:**
   ```bash
   Strength: Weak
   Entropy: 25.76 bits
   Suggestions:
   - Use at least 12 characters (yours is 8).
   - Add special symbols.

   Try one of these:
   Random: U#e%zP2$Q8!tW3^b
   Passphrase: bravo-uniform-zulu-sierra

3. **Project Structure**
   ```bash
   password_tool.py   # Main script
   README.md          # Documentation
---
4. **Entropy Calculation**
   ```bash
   Entropy = length_of_password √ó log2(possible_characters)
## Where: Lowercase letters: 26 possible chars, Uppercase letters: 26 possible chars, Numbers: 10 possible chars, Symbols: 32 possible chars (from string.punctuation), Higher entropy = more randomness = harder to crack.
